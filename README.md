=========
Have you ever been to a party and been stuck listening to whatever pandora station your buddy chooses to put on the speakers? Well, now you can have your voice heard too! With Soniqueue, everyone at a party gets a say in what music is playing - everyone can make their own queue on their own Android devices, and the party host's device will automatically cycle through the various queues, giving everyone's music a chance to be played.

## Details
This repository includes a central server in the 'server' directory and an Android app in the 'Soniqueue' directory. The Android app can be opened directly as an Android Studio project. Various URLs in the Android app are hardcoded to connect to http://soniqueue.com, which is the address of our server. If running your own server, these will have to be changed.
