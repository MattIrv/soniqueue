soniqueue
=========
Have you ever been to a party and been stuck listening to whatever pandora station your buddy chooses to put on the speakers? Well, now you can have your voice heard too! With Soniqueue, everyone at a party gets a say in what music is playing - everyone can make their own queue on their own Android devices, and the party host's device will automatically cycle through the various queues, giving everyone's music a chance to be played.
